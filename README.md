# NullMoth NVIDIA Driver for macOS

A Metal driver for NVIDIA Turing-and-later cards on Intel Macs and OpenCore systems running **macOS 15 Sequoia**.
The device table includes GTX 16, RTX 20/30/40/50, TITAN RTX, and supported Quadro/RTX workstation cards.
Your NVIDIA card drives the desktop, Metal apps, games, Core ML/MPS, and OpenCL — the way an Apple-supported GPU does.

Made by **NullMoth Systems**.

**Latest maintenance update:** [1401 Mac 1.0.13 / driver package 1.0.9](docs/RELEASE-1.0.13.md). See the change list, validation and remaining work before updating.

Installing macOS from Windows? Use **1401**: https://github.com/nullmoth/1401

> **This driver is new and may not work on every PC.** It is tested on an RTX 5060 under macOS 15.7.x and 15.8.1. Device-table coverage is broader than physical hardware validation; see [card support](docs/CARD-SUPPORT.md). If your PC does
> not boot macOS with OpenCore yet, set that up first with the
> [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)
> ([OpenCore releases](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)), then install the driver.
> The full write-up of how the driver works is in [`docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md`](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| macOS | 15 Sequoia (tested 15.7.x and 15.8.1), x86_64 |
| GPUs | NVIDIA Turing and later from the GSP device table; physical validation: RTX 5060 |
| Metal | Metal 3: argument buffers tier 2, ray tracing, mesh shaders, MPS, MetalFX path |
| Also | OpenGL (through Apple's GL-on-Metal), OpenCL, Core Image, Core ML |

## How it works

```
Metal app ─► NVMTLDriver.bundle ─► translator (Apple AIR → SPIR-V) ─► NVK (Mesa Vulkan + NAK compiler) ─► kexts ─► GPU
```

| Component | Path on disk | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Metal driver plugin | `/Library/GPUBundles/NVMTLDriver.bundle` | `plugin/` |
| Shader translator | inside the plugin (`libnvmtl_translate.dylib`) | `translator/` (LGPL-3.0, based on metal2vulkan) |
| Vulkan back end (NVK) | `/Library/GPUBundles/nvmtl/` | `nvk/nvk-macos.patch` on Mesa `17ca6174` |
| Kernel extensions | `/Library/Extensions/NVRM, NVAccel, NVRMFB, NVRMAGDC` | `kexts/` |
| GPU firmware (GSP) | `/Users/Shared/nvfw/nvidia/610.57.04` | NVIDIA, unmodified |

The kernel side runs NVIDIA's own open GPU kernel modules (r610) under macOS. NVRMFB is the display framebuffer,
NVAccel the accelerator WindowServer composites through, NVRMAGDC the display-policy shim.

## Install — prebuilt (recommended)

Download `nullmoth-nvidia-<version>.tar.gz` from **Releases**, then:

```bash
tar -xzf nullmoth-nvidia-*.tar.gz && cd pkgroot
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS          # every file must say OK
sudo ./install.sh                    # copies the files, rebuilds the Auxiliary Kernel Collection
sudo shutdown -r now                 # a reboot is required: logout does not load the driver
```

macOS asks you to **allow the extensions** in System Settings → Privacy & Security the first time. Allow, then reboot again.

## 1401 Mac app (easiest)

Download the latest `1401-Mac-<version>.dmg` from **Releases**, open it, and run **1401** (the driver package is inside the disk
image, so nothing else to download). Follow its four steps. It works on any OpenCore
setup, whether 1401 built it or you did: it finds the OpenCore that started your Mac (in `EFI/OC` or `EFI/BOOT`, on an
EFI or FAT32 partition), shows every change before making it, backs the config up, installs the driver, and adds
**1401: Remove NVIDIA driver** to the OpenCore boot picker. Choosing that entry removes the driver at the next start and
puts the Mac back exactly as it was before the install, OpenCore config included, then restarts by itself. The app also
maps your USB ports and, if the driver ever crashes the Mac, offers to make a crash report you can upload yourself
(it never sends anything on its own).

**Something not working?** Open 1401 > Crash report > **Send logs to NullMoth**. It sends what 1401 did, the driver's
state, driver crash reports, recent WindowServer crash reports and OpenCore's startup logs (names, serial numbers and addresses removed), each
with a SHA-256 the site checks, and shows a report ID to quote in the NullMoth Discord.

**macOS 26 Tahoe (beta):** the package carries a Tahoe build of NVAccel. Click **Prepare this Mac for Tahoe** before updating
in System Settings; the first start of Tahoe sets the driver up and restarts once. Not yet tested on hardware.

**Keep the USB stick or disk OpenCore started your Mac from plugged in** while the app runs: that is the config it
changes. It only edits a config whose SMBIOS model matches this Mac, and stops if none is connected. After the install,
restart; the first start with the driver pauses for up to a minute at "PCI configuration end" while the GPU comes up.

## Wiring into an existing OpenCore setup

The kexts install into `/Library/Extensions` and load from the Auxiliary Kernel Collection — **do not** also inject
them from `EFI/OC/Kexts`. OpenCore only needs to set SIP and boot-args.

**`NVRAM → Add → 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82`**

| Key | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `csr-active-config` | `<430A0000>` (Data) | the tested value: unsigned kexts, plus what root patches need |
| `boot-args` | `nvfb=1 nvaccel=1 nvfbheads=4 -nvkmsnosmooth amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1 amfi=0x80` | framebuffer + accelerator, 4 display heads; the AMFI args let WindowServer load the driver bundle |

Add every key you set to `NVRAM → Delete` as well, so the values are rewritten each boot.

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `UEFI → Quirks → ResizeGpuBars` | `13` | 8 GB BAR: full memory bandwidth (tested on the RTX 5060) |
| `Booter → Quirks → ResizeAppleGpuBars` | `-1` | macOS sees the full BAR |
| `Kernel → Block` | `com.apple.iokit.IONDRVSupport`, Strategy `Exclude` | otherwise the firmware framebuffer takes display index 0 from NVRMFB |
| `Misc → Security → SecureBootModel` | `Disabled` | Apple Secure Boot refuses kexts Apple did not sign |

The macOS **installer** needs the opposite BAR settings (`ResizeAppleGpuBars` `0`, `ResizeGpuBars` `-1`, IONDRVSupport
not excluded): it has no NVIDIA driver and runs on the firmware's screen. 1401 builds installers that way, and the 1401
Mac app switches to the values above when it installs the driver.

Also required:
- **BIOS:** Above 4G Decoding ON (the card maps memory above 4 GB), CSM OFF.
- **SMBIOS:** a Mac model that runs macOS 15 with a discrete GPU (tested: `iMacPro1,1`, which 1401 uses).
- **Remove** any `nv_disable=1`, WhateverGreen NVIDIA patches, or `agdpmod=pikera` for this card.
- **No `DeviceProperties`** are needed for the NVIDIA card.

Verify after the reboot:

```bash
kmutil showloaded --list-only | grep nullmoth      # 4 lines
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | head -20      # your GeForce, Metal: supported
```

## Dual boot

Nothing in the driver touches other disks. OpenCore's picker boots Windows (`ScanPolicy` 0 or including NTFS) and Linux
(`OpenLinuxBoot.efi` in `UEFI → Drivers`, `LauncherOption = Full`) alongside macOS.

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh && sudo shutdown -r now
```

## Build from source

Requires Xcode 16, Rust (stable), Meson/Ninja, and NVIDIA's `open-gpu-kernel-modules` at tag `610.57.04`.

See [`docs/BUILDING.md`](docs/BUILDING.md) before building. GitHub Actions builds the repository components, kexts,
patched NVK runtime, and Vulkan loader from pinned source revisions. It obtains only the required binary firmware from
NVIDIA's official, checksum-pinned 610.57.04 package. A manual packaging workflow accepts only successful artifacts
from the same source commit, then emits the hand-install tarball, app ZIP, and DMG. The unreproducible optional
`NVIDIAShared.bundle` is not included.

```bash
build/build_xlate.sh       # translator  -> libnvmtl_translate.dylib
RELEASE=1 build/build_plugin.sh   # plugin -> NVMTLDriver.bundle (RELEASE=1 strips every diagnostic)
build/build_runtime_ci.sh  # CI: patched NVK + Vulkan loader from pinned checkouts
build/accel_build.sh <src> <out>  # NVAccel.kext only; see docs/BUILDING.md for the missing kext recipes
```
